# Reverse-engennering-a-malware-backdoor
Creating a malware backdoor using reverse engineering by making python codes.

## Abstract
The increasing popularity of applications accompanies with it an ever-growing field of malware. Hence, the need of the hour is to design a malware backdoor to see how the mechanism works in a malware which intrudes into the system and damages the file system by various methods. Using reverse engineering the malware is developed which can enter an Operating system and can operate on commands and file systems. Our study aims to use the socket programming to bind and connect the devices and running the commands of hacked device into the hacker’s device using subprocesses. The malware will be containing two files named as backdoor and listener and renamed with python extension. Further the algorithm contains a method to run all kinds of commands of hacked operating system and by establishing the connection, uploading and downloading of file system which can be done from hacker’s device to a hacked device and vice-versa. The results will be further shared showing the conclusion as the connection between these two connected devices in a network and running different commands over it.

## Introduction
Today's technological threats can be divided into four groups: defects, denial-of-service attacks (DoS), spam, and malicious software. The fundamental cause of these threats is how serious they are in the modern world. The actual risk that can attack the device in real time is malicious content, and there is a wide range of this type of content. Worms, horses, spyware, backdoors, and viruses are a few examples of dangerous software. Backdoors are a specialised type of malicious software that typically steals data from computers and inserts destructive code into files to render the system inoperable. It can gain remote access from any location and could cause issues for databases, servers, and large systems that contain sensitive and essential data.
Backdoors are a specialised type of malicious software that typically steals data from computers and inserts destructive code into files to render the system inoperable. It can gain remote access from any location and could cause issues for databases, servers, and large systems that contain sensitive and essential data. The backdoors typically sneak in as system executables or as downloadable file systems from the internet. Most importantly, it makes it difficult to detect if installed in a system because it hides in the files. The technique of looking for such dangerous files with backdoors is disguised. When this malware hits servers, there are typically not many activity visible, but there may be data loss because the data has been stolen. In some cases, websites are intentionally damaged or DDoS attacks are launched. Additionally, it causes attacks in resort areas, which lower website traffic. Additionally, several APT attacks have been proven to have compromised sensitive data.
This paper outlines a method for creating malware backdoors with the aid of reverse engineering. A malware programme is essentially disassembled into its core code for this study, which is then evaluated over another operating system in a network. Running the codes in this paper on sample devices with Windows 11 as the operating system allows for their creation and dynamic analysis. Kali Linux, a Debian variant used for auditing the security of any server or computer and including penetration testing, is the operating system used to hack this example operating system. The connection between the two computers is established using socket programming.

## Methodology
The operation of this specific python file is described here, and the technique is straightforward to use in real-time machines. The Linux machine running Kali or Debian first launches the Listener Python file, which has been given an IP address and a generated Port number (which is not functional). The sockets programming in Python is divided into two sections: the listener and the backdoor or primary infection. To get the IP address it needs to connect, the listener Python file will first listen to incoming connections. When a Windows operating system file with the same IP address as the listener python file is simultaneously running over the same network. The backdoor file that began working in Windows won't display anything, but the command will continue to operate until the connection between the two operating systems is not shut down. The connection established by the socket programming between the two operating systems is so tight-knit that it will remain intact even if Windows shuts down and restarts. Since the Windows operating system is connected to the real-time hacking machine through the network router. A machine is discovered for the same IP address that was entered inside the code that is calling an object, according to the Kali machine terminal, which will flag the listened IP address.With the aid of standard commands like cd (change directory), md (create directory), mv <a> <b> (changing files within the system), arp (arp tables), and many more, the hacker can enter the system after making this connection. These operations are being carried out on the Kali system with the aid of the subprocess Python library. Each command's output is run by the subprocess library and returned to the Kali machine screen. The kali machine is used as another source of input. Furthermore, as is common knowledge, malware is defined as anything that damages the system. But nothing untoward has been observed up until this point. As a result, we are able to download and upload any file or folder to and from the system on both the Kali machine and the Windows machine, depending on the malicious activity. Consider a programme like ransomware, which often extracts data from the system and then demands payment as a ransom to restore the files. Therefore, a hacker utilising this window encryption may encrypt the crucial information or could stop system operations as an administrator. Two Python libraries are used to create the entire procedure or algorithm. Since one time a command throws a command, the Windows command prompt receives the command and replies the output but the command doesn't execute fully because for one mode of transfer between devices it takes only one packet of data to transfer from one system to another, the files may not get the complete description or the quantity of files is very low. Therefore, the packet cannot have a lot of information. For instance, ifconfig is a command that displays if the system's network interfaces are connected or disconnected as well as a wealth of IP and MAC address information as well as some in-depth features that include DNS and much more. When a command is entered into a Kali system, the Windows machine may not respond with the complete command output. Therefore, a python library called base64 was used to encrypt the entire output data into a data packet. The packet was then transferred to another end with the aid of a python library called the Json library, and at the kali machine end, the packet was decrypted to reveal the full report of the command that was entered. With the use of base64 conversion and json transmitter and receiver, large files can also be read.

## Conclusion
With the growing popularity of programmes comes an ever-expanding range of malware. As a result, it is urgently important to develop a malware backdoor to investigate the behaviour of malware that infiltrates the system and has a variety of effects on the file system. Reverse engineering is used to create malware that can enter an operating system and access commands and file systems. Our research aims to use socket programming to bind and connect the devices while employing subprocesses to execute commands from compromised devices into the hacker's device. Two files with the names backdoor and listener that have been renamed with the extension "python" will be included with the malware. The programme also features a method for uploading and downloading file systems from a hacker's device to a compromised device and vice versa, as well as for carrying out any operating system hacker command. Following the presentation of the data, the conclusion will show how these two connected devices interact with one another in a network and how different commands are carried out there.
